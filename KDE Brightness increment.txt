Guide to setting brightness increments in KDE. Probably not the best implementation as this requires leaving your password openly in a file. Use this method at your own discretion.

1. Find a directory to store 2 shell scripts we will be making to control brightness. Heck, could even be your desktop.
2. Use any tool (vim/nano/vs code/etc) to create two new files. I named mine brightness_up.sh and brightness_down.sh respectively.
3. Use your file explorer and locate the brightness file at /sys/class/backlight/______/brightness. The underscore part depends on the make of your computer. My path is /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness.
4. Now, copy the path of the brightness file.
5. Return back to the 2 .sh scripts. Copy and paste the following 3 lines into each script. Replacement with your own path and password (keep the password's quotation marks).

brightness_up.sh
> x="$(cat /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness)"
> echo "passw0rd" | sudo -S tee /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness
> echo $(($x+1)) | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness

brightness_down.sh
> x="$(cat /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness)"
> echo "passw0rd" | sudo -S tee /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness
> echo $(($x-1)) | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness

6. Remember to save the files!
7. Now, go to KDE's System Settings>Shortcuts>Custom Shortcuts. 
8. Click Edit>New Group. I renamed the new group to "Brightness".
9. Click on the newly created group, click Edit>New>Global Shortcut>Command/URL. Do this twice.
10. Go to the trigger tab, assign your current brightness up key. If the system prompts you to reassign previous setting, say yes.
11. In the action tab, key in the following:
> bash /PATH TO FILE/brightness_up.sh
12. Do it gain for brightness down.
13. It should now work!
